## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## problem 1 (can skip- for self to understand, explain)
```{r}

library(tibble)

# set number of subjects per cell

n <- 10
factorial_data <- tibble(A = factor(rep(c("L1","L2"), each = n)),
                         B = factor(rep(c("L1","L2"), n)),
                         C = factor(rep(c ("A", "B", "C", "D")), each = n/2),
                         DV = c(rnorm(n/2, -2 ,1), 
                              rnorm(n/2,-2,1),
                              rnorm(n/2,2,1),
